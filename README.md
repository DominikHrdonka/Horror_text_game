# Text Game

#
# DISCLAIMER:
# The game is still being developed. It serves mainly to show my OOP (and story-telling) skills. 
#
# GAME INTRO:
# ---------------
# You wake up in the middle of a dark room. Your head is throbbing with pain. Memories seem to have fled away. What is that place? And how did you get there? Thinking hurts. All you know is that you need to get out of there.
#
# NOTES TO GAMEPLAY
# ------------------
# - the door code is temporarily set to 111. That will change with finishing the appropriate dialogue branch
#
# NOTES ON WHAT YET NEEDS TO BE DONE:::::
# ---------------------------------------
# 
# - use encapsulation to protect attributes from tampering
# - add the dialogue branch about getting the code 
# - build options and story for the library location
# - add locations and interaction with "move to the desk" 
# - come up with logic of the crone's movement on the map
