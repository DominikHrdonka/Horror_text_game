# Text Game
# ---------
# NOTE:::::
# - make changes to explore function - probably make changes
# so that you start in the dark room with the appropiate 
# options. 
# - 
# - check whether the sink_without_scalpel changes properly after taking the scalpel
# 
# - IMPORTANT - I need to be able to change available choices. For example, when you open the door with the key, you need new choice to become available: go to another room
#

This text-game is supposed to demonstrate my skills in OOP.
# 
# I am starting small:
#
# 1. defining the main compononents of the game like
# classes, properties and objects.
# 
# 2. making locations according to the pre-defined map
