# Text Game

#
# DISCLAIMER:
# The game is still being developed. It serves mainly to show my OOP (and story-telling) skills. 
#
# GAME INTRO:
# You wake up in the middle of a dark room. Your head is throbbing with pain. Memories seem to have fled away. What is that place? And how did you get there? Thinking hurts. All you know is that you need to get out of there.

#
# NOTES ON WHAT YET NEEDS TO BE DONE:::::
# 
# - FINISH THE DIALOGUE!!!! going on with question_three etc.
# - check whether the sink_without_scalpel changes properly after taking the scalpel
