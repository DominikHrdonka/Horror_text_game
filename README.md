# DISCLAIMER:
# The game is still being developed. It serves mainly to show my OOP (and story-telling) skills. 
#
# GAME INTRO:
# ---------------
# You wake up in the middle of a dark room. Your head is throbbing with pain. Memories seem to have fled away. What is that place? And how did you get there? Thinking hurts. All you know is that you need to get out of there.

# NOTES ON WHAT YET NEEDS TO BE DONE:::::
# ---------------------------------------
# 
# - use encapsulation to protect attributes from tampering
# 
# - build options and story for the library location
# - user input must comply with the given choices (so far I will leave it for purpose of testing)
# - 
# - 
# -
# - INVENTORY - finish the logic to update inventory choices dynamically
#             - add option to open inventory to every location
